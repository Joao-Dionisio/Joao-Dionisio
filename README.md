I'm a PhD student working on maintenance-scheduling problems in complex machinery, focusing on Dantzig-Wolfe decompositions. I'm also the maintainer of [PySCIPOpt](https://github.com/scipopt/PySCIPOpt), the Python interface for the academic solver [SCIP](https://www.scipopt.org). Update: This will largely be on hiatus for the year of 2025/2026, to focus on my PhD.

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joao-dionisio/) and [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joao_Dionisio6). 

If some of my research interests you, feel free to message me!

As far as hobbies go, I'm somewhat serious about chess, mostly in organizing tournaments. You can check the chessresults of the latest edition of the Maia Chess Festival [here](https://s3.chess-results.com/tnr1136199.aspx?lan=1&art=0&flag=30&SNode=S0). 330 players from 44 different countries, with 13 Grandmasters and 14 International masters, playing 9 days of classical chess.
