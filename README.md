I'm a PhD student working on maintenance-scheduling problems in complex machinery, focusing on Dantzig-Wolfe decompositions. I'm also a contributor at [PySCIPOpt](https://github.com/scipopt/PySCIPOpt), the Python interface for the academic solver [SCIP](https://www.scipopt.org).

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joao-dionisio/) and [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joao_Dionisio6). 

If some of my research interests you, feel free to message me!

As far as hobbies go, I've been getting more serious about chess over the past few months :)
